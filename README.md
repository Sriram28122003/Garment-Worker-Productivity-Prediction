Garment Worker Productivity Prediction
The garment industry is one of the largest industries in the world, and garment worker productivity is a crucial factor in determining the success and profitability of a company. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the productivity of garment workers based on a given set of features. Our dataset contains information on various attributes of garment production, including the quarter, department, day, team number, time allocated, unfinished items, over time, incentive, idle time, idle men, style change, number of workers, and actual productivity. We will use this dataset to train and evaluate our predictive model.
The development of an accurate garment worker productivity prediction model using machine learning can have significant implications in various domains, including manufacturing, human resources, and supply chain management. This model can help companies identify the factors that affect worker productivity and take corrective actions to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance their competitiveness in the market.project demo link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/10XZhs_TahV7tiozQh7BCIDhzADuRb3wZ/view?usp=sharing
